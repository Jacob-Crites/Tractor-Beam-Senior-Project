# Tractor_Beam_Senior_Project
Senior Design project done at University of Texas at Arlington. Goal is to design an autonomous vehicle to track and follow a 1:16 scale RC car while using PID control so that the tracking is smooth enough to not spill a full cup of water placed on the autonomous vehicle.
